# Welcome to Timon

Timon efficiently manages your cloud infrastructures ðŸš€

Automate infrastructure as code (IaC) provisioning at any scale,
at any cloud or data center with any tool. Through a single central
API. Freely definable cloud infrastructures at the push of a button
as self-service.

Currently, the development of the data model and the API as well as
the respective CLI and SDK is in its final stages. A first alpha
version of the public Timon service will be available soon. The first
parts, such as sample environments and blueprints, are already available
as previews.
